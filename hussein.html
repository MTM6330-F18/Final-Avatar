                                Management Systems (CMS) offer pre-built functionality that designers and developers can work
                                with to deliver diverse, feature-rich, modern websites. Students learn first-hand how to quickly
                                install, configure, customize and style websites built on these systems. In addition, students learn
                                how and when using a CMS is appropriate, when it can benefit projects and clients and how to
                                integrate a variety of social media systems within their CMS.</p>

                          <h3>A Little Bit About Your Background...</h3>
                          <p> I started working in web development and created my first website in 1997, in high school and it was always a hobby, I never took a formal training web development or design. I thought it as a hobby. After I got master, I got a job in web development I decided that I enjoy doing this so much I rather do this than what I’m studying. I worked in web development about 10 years professionally before I get to teaching.</p>
                          <h3>How Many Courses Do You Teach?</h3>
                          <p>I’ll be doing warning ensemble today talking to be the biggest use of time management one concepts and projects PRI projects dish washing pixel clause in the motion graphics motion graphics motion graphics budget video one Else or Motion graphics motion graphics budget video one multimedia design 1 and 2
                                    Also, digital publishing.</p>
                                    <h3>Why do you like teaching?</h3>
                                    <p>oh, I like teaching because I’m sharing knowledge, and This is a really really enjoyed that. The fact that you know I feel that I know that how to do a certain thing and I’m able to teach someone else how to do it right that feels me like absolutely good.</p> 
                          <h3>What Would You Do With a Student Who Is Not Doing Well?</h3>
                          <p>Okay well for a student who is not doing well there is really different reasons.
                                    It Could be because maybe they are trying to do better but it’s not working for them or they are purposely not doing well.
                                    They don’t want to do well. so, u can do whatever you want to do with someone that wants to not doing well and u are not able to take them anywhere because it’s a two-week communication, right? so if they are not really responding and not really trying to actually help then it’s not going to work , but if the students trying to do well but did not be able to maybe there is something I need to change to make it easier for them. so, the first thing for any problem in life really you really have to find what the problem is and then to admit what that problem is, and then try to work from there. so really could Be time management it could be being distracted, it could be because the teachers going very too fast or maybe teacher explaining things in a certain way that doesn’t really relate to the student. so really think I would do whatever it actually takes student is getting what they need.
